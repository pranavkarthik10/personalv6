I wanted to document everything I use, from technology, to apps, to platforms. I know I'm always looking out for inspiration on 
small ways to improve my life, so I'm hoping this can be useful in some way.

## Hardware

### Laptop

- MacBook Pro M1 Pro (2021) - The M-series of chips have been nothing short of amazing, and this laptop has served me well for all these years. Only thing is some bottlenecking on the RAM (it has 16gb), and the storage (512gb).

### Mouse

- Logitech MX Master 3S - The GOAT of mice imo. Everything from ergonomics, to configurability using Logi Options, to the 3 device selector on the mouse. I can use one mouse for my PC, personal laptop, and work laptop at the same time.  Also, pretty solid battery life.

### Keyboard

- Magi65 Pro

- Keychron K2

### EDC

- iPhone 17 Pro
- Airpods Pro 3
- Airpods Max

### Desk

- PC

### Consoles

- Steam Deck (OLED)


## Tools I'm Using

- **Code Editor:** Cursor / VS Code with Cline/Roo-Code - I've also tried various other platforms and tools, and I use them from time to time. But in the end I prefer being able to see my code and take action in the IDE. And beyond that it's all just different agent loops and models.

- **Terminal:** Ghostty / Warp

- **Note Taking:** Obsidian

- **To-do Tracking:** Todoist - Always a struggle as I think the convenience of Apple Reminders is the best but at times I want something cross platform or easily accessible from the web. 

- **Misc**
    - Raycast
    - AltTab
    - f.lux


## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Mobile:** SwiftUI, Xcode, Expo
- **Backend**
- **Database:** 
- **Deployment:** Vercel
