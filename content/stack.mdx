I wanted to document everything I use, from technology, to apps, to platforms. I know I'm always looking out for inspiration on 
small ways to improve my life, so I'm hoping this can be useful in some way.

## Hardware

### Laptop

- MacBook Pro M1 Pro (2021) - The M-series of chips have been nothing short of amazing, and this laptop has served me well for all these years. Only thing is some bottlenecking on the RAM (it has 16gb), and the storage (512gb).

### Mouse

- Logitech MX Master 3S - The GOAT of mice imo. Everything from ergonomics, to configurability using Logi Options, to the 3 device selector on the mouse. I can use one mouse for my PC, personal laptop, and work laptop at the same time.  Also, pretty solid battery life.

- IPI Float 18 - ultralight gaming mouse, pretty affordable and has good features

### Keyboard

- Magi65 Pro

- Keychron K2

### Everyday Carry

- iPhone 17 Pro
- Airpods Pro 3
- Airpods Max

### Personal Computer

- **Case** Fractal Design Terra
- **CPU** AMD Ryzen 7600X
- **GPU** NVIDIA RTX 4070 Super
- **RAM** GSkill Flare X5 32 GB
- **Motherboard** ASRock B650I
- **Storage** TEAMGROUP MP33 2 TB
- **PSU** Corsair SF750

### Monitor

- Samsung OLED G6 (G61SD) - Incredible monitor. OLED is one of those things you need to see to believe. After using this, when you go back to a regular IPS panel it feels like everything's faded. Viewing angles are also really nice, it's crisp no matter how you look at it.

### Consoles

- Steam Deck (OLED)

### Misc

- Magcubic HY300 - Very cheap and compact projector. Yes, there are much better projectors out there, but arguably for this price ($40) you get a decent projector especially in really dark settings. Been a lifesaver during two of my internships where the place I stayed at didn't have a TV and it's too much of a hassle to buy one. Easy to pack into luggage as well. 

## Tools I'm Using

- **Browser** 

    - Dia - Similar to other people, I was an avid Arc user until it stopped being actively worked on and it's been downhill since then. I've tried Zen, and other alternatives but prefer Chromium. Still, this has the best AI integration at the moment and is fun to use, albeit missing many Arc features.
    - Firefox - primary browser on my PC


- **Code Editor:** Cursor / VS Code with Cline/Roo-Code - I've also tried various other platforms and tools, and I use them from time to time. But in the end I prefer being able to see my code and take action in the IDE. And beyond that it's all just different agent loops and models which are constantly changing.

- **Terminal:** Ghostty / Warp

- **Note Taking:** Obsidian

- **To-do Tracking:** Todoist - Always a struggle as I think the convenience of Apple Reminders is the best but at times I want something cross platform or easily accessible from the web. 

- **Misc**
    - Raycast
    - AltTab
    - f.lux
